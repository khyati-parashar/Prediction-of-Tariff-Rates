# Prediction-of-Tariff-Rates

Tariff is a list of expenses that incur while transporting the goods from one distance to another distance. Tariff is also
dependent on seasonal and non-seasonal factors also. This project is aimed at predicting the tariff ratesfor truck load by using the
different machine learning algorithmslike lasso regression, elastic net regression, ridge regression and linear regression. Tariffisa
combination of lot ofthings and tariff rate is dependent on some ofthe factorslikeYear, Road, SeasonalImpact, Fuel Cost,Distance,
Weight, Toll charge, Demand, labour cost, travel expenses etc. Using some ofthese factors and by employing the above-mentioned
machine learning regression algorithms we will be trying to predict the tariff rates on the trucks. By doing this we can help the
industriesto estimate the tariffratesso that they can take the necessary actions and they can make their business run inprofitable
way. This model helps small- and large-scale firms to control and manage the cost on transport.

This project deals with the problems oftariff rates prediction for this purpose a gaggle of choices characterizing the tariff rate
area unit used to predict the tariff rate. Variety of the factors to be coarctated are seasonal Impact, Fuel Cost, Distance, Toll
charge. Few ofthese factors we tend to area unit progressing to conclude relating to the tariff rates oftruck on wholly various
things by applying the machine learning models. Tariffs might be a listing of expenses that incur whereas transporting the
merchandise from one-distance to a unique distance. Ability to incorporate external factors listed beneath factors heading
below. This project is back-geared toward predicting the tariff rates for truck load. Factors (to be included) Year,Road, seasonal
Impact, Fuel Cost, Distance, Weight, Toll charge, Demand, Travel expenses[6]. Pattern few of these factors we tend to area unit
progressing to concluded relating to the tariff rates on the trucks. Machine Learning is one in all the foremost hot analysis
topics in engineering, which is applicable in several disciplines. It provides a set of algorithms, strategies and tools able to
embody some reasonably intelligence to machines. The facility of metric capacity unitis thattheprovided modelling tools,that
can be trained, via a learning procedure, with a collection of information describing a downside and to reply to similar unseen
information with a typical method. Machine learning plays a serious role from past years in image detection, spam
reorganization, normal speech command, product recommendation and diagnosing. Gift machine learning algorithm helps
U.S.A. in enhancing security alerts, guaranteeing public safety and improve medical enhancements. Machine learning system
additionally provides higher client service and safe automobile systems.

1.1 Linear regression
Linear Regression could be a machine learning formula supported supervised learning. It performs a regression task.
Regression models a target prediction worth supported freelance variables. Itis mostly used for locating out the link between
variables and prognostication. Different regression models disagree supported – the type of relationship between dependent
and freelance variables, they're considering and the range of freelance variables getting used.


1.2 Lasso regression
The lasso regression model was developed in 1989. It’s primarily another to the classic least squares estimate to avoid several
ofthe issues with over fitting once we have an outsized number of freelance variables. By mistreatment giant constant,we tend
to are golf shot a large stress on the actual feature that it will be a good predictor ofthe result. And once it's overlarge, the rule
starts modelling knotty relations to calculate the output & finishes up over fitting to the actual information. Lasso regression
adds an element of the total of absolutely the price of the coefficients the improvement objective
